As Team Lead, I oversaw the design, planning, and execution of a go-kart made from upcycled furniture and powered by a weed-wacker engine.

## 🛠️ Responsibilities
- Led design and build sessions
- Coordinated team logistics, training, and deadlines
- Disassembled and repurposed small engines
- Managed budget and materials sourcing

## 🏛️ The Chassis

Our chassis was made from pieces of scrap 2x3 in plywood (courtesy of the Shop staff), aluminum bars, threaded zinc-plated rod, and hardware from Home Depot. Limited by the length of wooden members received.

**Design Considerations**
- What direction is the wood grain?
- Budget
- Rear Axle Assembly
- Flexible Steering (more on that later)

## 🧩 Steering the Ship
Our first idea for the steering mechanism was to implement a rack and pinion mechanism. We weren’t able to find cheap steering knuckle spindles for that. In the end, we opted for a simpler system → rope that rotates a wooden beam about a pivot.

**Design Considerations**
- Skill
- Budget

## 🛞 The Wheels
Due to our steering being rotating a beam about a pivot, we needed to find a way to connect our wheels to wooden beams. Nothing in our vicinity to drill a 5⁄8” hole through a 2’ 2 3⁄4” long beam →came up with the idea of end caps.

We then created end caps that allow a 7⁄8” bolt to pass through and screw it to the end of the beam. Thought a lot about stress concentration factors and strength → printed caps with fillets and as much infill possible (also paying attention to print orientation).

**Design Considerations**
- Load on the end caps
- What type of wheels did we recieve?

## 🚗 The Engine (what went wrong)
The goal the President bestowed was to create a functioning go-kart powered by a weed-wacker engine.

**Problems**
- Faulty engines
- Cross-Team Communication
- Skill
- Team of different skill sets
- Initial mechanism was too large for the flap on the frame
- Time

## 😰 Main Challenges

**1. Guidance**
Due to various events, I was dropped into the role of Team Lead without having enough experience to lead my team. We were learning together, but there were some aspects of the project that I felt I could've been a better leader by knowing more about. I would've caught the issue with the sooner.

**2. Testing Too Late and Pivoting**
Problems like what we experienced with the rear axle were caught too close to our deadline, which made it hard for everyone to pivot to creating model cars. I feel like testing various things earlier on would've helped our process a lot more.

## 💡 Lessons Learned
- Earlier testing = better pivots
- Don’t underestimate the time needed to teach and lead a team
- Scrap materials can push creativity when budget is tight
