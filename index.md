## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/headshot.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
Hello! My name is Benjamin and I’m a second-year Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University. I’m passionate about all things technology and finding new ways to use engineering to improve our way of life and work. Some of my goals are to collaborate with people on projects and foster my skills as an engineer.

Currently, I serve as President of Cornell’s Entertainment Engineering and Design Club (CEED) where we work collaboratively to create fun and simple engineering projects. Some of our most notable projects have been an Axolotl-themed animatronic and a go-kart inspired by furniture. Right now, I'm interested in gaining experience as a mechanical designer.
